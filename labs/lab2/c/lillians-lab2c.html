  <p>Over winter break, I took an Intro to Photography class. I haven't taken an art class since<br>
    high school, and I was excited to do so again. Each week had a different assignment. For the<br>
    photos I'm including here, we were tasked with posing our own still-lifes, and they had to<br>
    include a repeated shape. In these four photos, you can see circles, spirals, and wispy lines.</p>
