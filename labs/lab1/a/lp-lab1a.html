    <h3>About Lillian</h3>
        <p>
            I grew up in <em>Connecticut</em> and live in <em>Brookline</em> now. I just started my last semester at BU.
           <br><em>I'll be graduating in May</em> as an English major.
            <br>I enjoy cooking, reading, and writing during the week,
            <br>and watching sit-coms and learning about art on the weekends.
            <br>I miss my family dog; he still lives in CT.
        </p>
