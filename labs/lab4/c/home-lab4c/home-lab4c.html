        <h3><em>Brief History</em></h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Hartford, CT is a very historic New England town. It is where the first constitution was written,
            which has earned us the nickname "The Constitution State".<br>Puritan settlers led by Thomas Hooker
            left Massachusetts in 1635, two years after Hooker first left England. He was a minister. But,
            the Puritans were not the first<br>settlers of Hartford. Indigenous people well occupied the land
            (and are responsible for the state's name), and there were Dutch communities as well.
            Hartford is<br>one of the thirteen original colonies, was named after a British town, and is the capital of CT.

            Until college, I spent my life there. My mom, my grandparents, and my great-grandparents were also raised in Hartford, CT.
