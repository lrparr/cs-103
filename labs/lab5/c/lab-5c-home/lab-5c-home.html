            Halloween has religious roots, but nowadays, it's a holiday that has a mind of its own.<br>
        Celebrities compete with each other and even their past-selves to adorn extravagant costumes;<br>
        costume selection is a big part of many kids' childhoods; pets even get to dress up, too.<br>
        There are also different ways to view the holiday. I like it because I love the dark, chilling<br>
        vibe of the fall, but others choose to view it more lighthearted. Either way, it is definitely<br>
        an important time of year, though I feel like we just left it.
